## Get started

- Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Join the [Ballerina community](https://ballerina.io/community/).
- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing code. [Report an issue](https://github.com/ballerina-nutcracker/ballerina/issues) in this repo.
- Start with GitHub issues labeled `good first issue`. Use comments on the issue to indicate that you will be working on it and get guidance.

## Build the source code

- Ensure you have [Go 1.26 or later](https://go.dev/dl/).
- Release build: `go build -o bal ./cli/cmd`
- Debug build (enables profiling): `go build -tags debug -o bal-debug ./cli/cmd`

See [doc/guides/DEVELOPING.md](doc/guides/DEVELOPING.md) for more details on debugging, running corpus tests, linting, and profiling, and [doc/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md](doc/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the code is organized.

## Submit your contribution

1. Make your changes in the source code.
2. Add or update tests as needed. Prefer [corpus tests](AGENTS.md#corpus-tests) for interpreter stages; use `-update` to refresh expected output when appropriate.
3. Commit and push to your fork, then open a Pull Request (PR).

   **Commit message guidelines:**

   This repo allows merge commit, squash, and rebase merges, so every commit
   you push can end up in the `main` history as-is. Because of that, the PR
   title **and every commit subject** must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

   ```text
   <type>(<optional scope>): <description>
   ```

   - `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `revert`
   - `scope` is optional and usually the affected package (e.g., `ast`, `cli`, `http`, `semantics`)
   - `description` starts with a lowercase letter, uses the imperative mood (e.g., "add X" not "added X"), and does not end with a period
   - Keep the subject line under ~50 characters where practical (72 max)
   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
   - Wrap the body at 72 characters
   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

   Example: `fix(ast): recover missing identifier nodes`

   Both the PR title and every commit subject are checked automatically by the [Lint PR](.github/workflows/lint-pr.yml) workflow.

4. If prompted, accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) when submitting your first PR.
