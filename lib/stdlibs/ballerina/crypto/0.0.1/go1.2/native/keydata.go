// keyData associates opaque Go key material (an *rsa.PrivateKey, *rsa.PublicKey,
// *ecdsa.PrivateKey, or *ecdsa.PublicKey) with the *values.Map backing a
// crypto:PrivateKey/PublicKey record.
//
// Ballerina mapping values are pure data with no encapsulation: nothing stops
// a caller from constructing a same-shaped record without ever going through
// decode/generate, so every reader here must tolerate a miss (see the
// "Uninitialized ... key" errors in rsa.go) rather than assume the
// association always exists. Keying by a weak pointer keeps the association
// entirely internal to this module — the runtime and other modules never see
// it — and it self-cleans once the Map becomes unreachable, so it cannot leak
// memory for keys that are dropped by the program.
//
// A sync.Map fits this access pattern (each entry written once at decode time
// and read many times by sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt) so concurrent key
// lookups from different strands proceed without serializing on a single lock.
